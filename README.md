#  Flamapp.AI Assignment — Android (Camera2 + JNI + OpenCV) + Web Viewer

This repository contains a **simplified but technically-correct scaffold** for the Flamapp.AI Software Engineering Intern (R&D) assignment.  
It demonstrates the required system design:

- Android **Camera2** capture
- **JNI bridge** to native C++ layer
- **OpenCV**-based frame processing (Canny Edge Detection)
- **OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer** (stub) for texture display
- A **TypeScript Web Viewer** displaying the processed frame
- Proper directory structure: `/app`, `/jni`, `/gl`, `/web`, `/docs`

This project is designed to show architecture, code structure, and understanding — exactly what the PDF expects.
